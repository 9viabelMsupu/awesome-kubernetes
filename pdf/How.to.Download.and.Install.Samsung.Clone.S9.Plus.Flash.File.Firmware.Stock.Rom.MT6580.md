Before we proceed, let us explain what is a flash file, firmware, or stock rom. A flash file is a file that contains the operating system and other software components of a device. A firmware is a specific type of flash file that controls the hardware functions of a device. A stock rom is the original flash file or firmware that comes pre-installed on a device.
 
Flashing a new flash file, firmware, or stock rom can help you restore your device to its factory settings, update its software version, or fix any software issues. However, flashing can also be risky if you do not follow the proper steps or use the wrong files. You may end up bricking your device or losing your data. Therefore, you should always backup your data before flashing and use only compatible files for your device.
